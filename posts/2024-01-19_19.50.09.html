[WIP, don't follow these yet] Today I flashed a modern Android version onto Lenovo Tab M8 FHD (TB-8705F) (and I can't get it to work)

!!! WARNING: WIP. I haven't done this <em>successfully</em> yet. Right now these instructions are DEFINITELY WRONG SOMEWHERE.

Follow these instructions at your own peril; I'm not responsible for any damage caused to your device, etc, etc.

I recommend doing this from Debian, if you try it. Note that <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=928551"><code>fastboot -w</code> doesn't work on Debian</a>, so you'll need do a factory reset using Recovery Mode.

You start by following <em><a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/running#unlocking-recent-devices">Google's insructions for unlocking the bootloader on recent devices</a></em>.

Then, because the device is compliant with <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html">Project Treble</a>, you can use a <em>Generic System Image</em> on the device.


Before you get started, download the ARM64 (no Google software) or ARM64+GMS (with Google's proprietary software) from <https://developer.android.com/topic/generic-system-image/releases#13-stable>. Extract that ZIP file to a new folder on the Debian system, and run all the commands below from that folder.

Now it's time to, hopefully, unlock the tablet's bootloader:

1. Turn off the tablet
2. Enter FASTBOOT mode by holding the power and volume down buttons until the device vibrates. It should say "FASTBOOT mode" on the screen.
3. Install adb, fastboot, and all the things they depend on:
` apt install adb fastboot
4. Plug the tablet into the Debian system via USB.
5. Start the unlock process by running:
` fastboot flashing unlock
6. Follow the instructions on the tablet to unlock the bootloader. It claims it'll void your warranty, but this device is so old that probably doesn't exist.

Now it's time to install it and prepare the device for use:

1. Flash the image:
` fastboot flash system system.img
2. Flash the vbmeta partition:
` fastboot flash vbmeta --disable-verity --disable-verification vbmeta.img
3. Reboot the tablet into recvory mode:
` fastboot reboot recovery
4. Select "Wipe data/factory reset", and then confirm.
5. Select "Wipe cache partition", and then confirm.
5. Reboot.

And now it boots and shows an animated "android" loading icon forever.
