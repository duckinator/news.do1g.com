[WIP, don't follow these yet] Today I flashed a modern Android version onto Lenovo Tab M8 FHD (TB-8705F)

!!! WARNING: WIP. I haven't done this <em>successfully</em> yet. Right now these instructions are DEFINITELY WRONG SOMEWHERE.

!!! WARNING: Once you flash a new image to the device, at boot it shows a message saying you have to press the power button or it'll reboot. If you don't do this, it'll keep rebooting forever.

Follow these instructions at your own peril; I'm not reesponsible for any damage caused to your device, etc, etc.

I recommend doing this from Debian, if you try it.

You start by following <em><a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/running#unlocking-recent-devices">Google's insructions for unlocking the bootloader on recent devices</a></em>.

Then, because the device is compliant with <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html">Project Treble</a>, you can use a <em>Generic System Image</em> on the device.

Before you get started, download the "system-td-arm64-ab-vanilla.img.xz" image from <https://github.com/TrebleDroid/treble_experimentations/releases>. You can theoretically use any version newer than what came on the device, but I'm trying Android 14.
Decompress the downloaded file using <code>unxz system-td-arm64-ab-vanilla.img.xz</code>.

Now it's time to, hopefully, unlock the tablet's bootloader:

1. Turn off the tablet
2. Enter FASTBOOT mode: Hold the power and volume down buttons until the device vibrates. It should say "FASTBOOT mode" on the screen.
3. Install adb, fastboot, and all the things they depend on:
` apt install adb fastboot
4. Plug the tablet into the Debian system via USB.
5. Start the unlock process by running:
` fastboot flashing unlock
6. Follow the instructions on the tablet to unlock the bootloader. It claims it'll void your warranty, but this device is so old that probably doesn't exist.

Now it's time to install it and prepare the device for use:

1. Flash the image:
` fastboot flash system system-td-arm64-ab-vanilla.img
2. Reboot into recovery mode. (I had some trouble with this; it dropped me into FASTBOOT again for some reason, so I just ran <code>fastboot reboot recovery</code>.)
3. Select "Wipe data/factory reset", then confirm it.
4. Select "Reboot system now".
