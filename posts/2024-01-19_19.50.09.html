Today I flashed a modern Android version onto Lenovo Tab M8 FHD (TB-8705F)

FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS AT YOUR OWN PERIL. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING.

DON'T DO THIS IF YOU'RE NOT OKAY WITH POTENTIALLY BRICKING YOUR DEVICE.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR DEVICE, YOUR DEVICE NOT WORKING, ETC.

I recommend doing this from Debian, if you try it. Note that <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=928551"><code>fastboot -w</code> doesn't work on Debian</a>, so you'll need do a factory reset using Recovery Mode instead!

You start by following <em><a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/running#unlocking-recent-devices">Google's insructions for unlocking the bootloader on recent devices</a></em>.

Then, because the device is compliant with <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html">Project Treble</a>, you can use a <em>Generic System Image</em> on the device.

Google provides official Generic System Images, but the Android 13 and Android 14 ones don't work on this tablet (and, it seems, many other devices).

There's another project, called <a href="https://github.com/TrebleDroid/treble_experimentations">Treble Droid</a>, which provides builds that have patches to work better on various devices. Their Android 14 image doesn't work on this tablet currently, but their Android 13 image does.

Download <https://github.com/TrebleDroid/treble_experimentations/releases/download/ci-20230905/system-td-arm64-ab-vanilla.img.xz> on the Debian system, and run all future commands from that directory.
  
Now it's time to, hopefully, unlock the tablet's bootloader:

1. Turn off the tablet
2. Enter FASTBOOT mode by holding the power and volume down buttons until the device vibrates. It should say "FASTBOOT mode" on the screen.
3. Install adb, fastboot, and all the things they depend on:
` apt install adb fastboot
4. Plug the tablet into the Debian system via USB.
5. Start the unlock process by running:
` fastboot flashing unlock
6. Follow the instructions on the tablet to unlock the bootloader. It claims it'll void your warranty, but this device is old enough that your warranty probably doesn't exist.

Now it's time to install it and prepare the device for use:

1. Flash the image:
` fastboot flash system system.img
3. Reboot the tablet into recvory mode:
` fastboot reboot recovery
4. Select "Wipe data/factory reset", and then confirm.
5. Select "Wipe cache partition", and then confirm.
5. Reboot.

<summary>IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, TRY THIS</summary>

You may need the vbmeta.img file from Google's. I had already tried flashing this before trying the TrebleDroid one which doesn't provide an equivalent, so <em>I don't know if it's needed or not</em>.
  
If you try this, download the ARM64 (no Google software) image from <https://developer.android.com/topic/generic-system-image/releases#13-stable>. Extract that ZIP file.

Then, from the directory that was extracted to:

1. Flash the vbmeta partition:
` fastboot flash vbmeta --disable-verity --disable-verification vbmeta.img
2. Reboot:
` fastboot reboot
