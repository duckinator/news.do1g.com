Getting Started With KDE Plasma Mobile

I've been playing a lot with KDE Plasma Mobile, and wanted to document my experiences so far.

Here's the setup I'm using, on both a <em>Dell Venue 11 Pro</em> (tablet with attachable keyboard) and a <em>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e</em> (2-in-1 where the keyboard can be flipped around behind the screen):

- Debian 12
- KDE + Plasma Mobile shell
- SDDM (display manager) with virtual keyboard enabled

I installed the base Debian 12 image, with sshd enabled (so I could manage them remotely for initial setup), then run these two commands as root:

# <code>apt install tmux htop plasma-mobile plasma-mobile-tweaks</code>
# <code>printf "\n[General]\nInputMethod=qtvirtualkeyboard\n" &gt;&gt; /etc/sddm.conf</code>

Then, add a user account for yourself (<code>adduser YOURUSERNAME</code> should do the trick), switch to that account, and run:

<code>printf "#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nloginctl unlock-session $1\n" &gt; ~/unlock.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x ~/unlock.sh</code>

This new <code>~/unlock.sh</code> script is to work around a problem with the screen locker. I'm hoping to figure out how to properly resolve that problem.

<h3>The kscreenlocker problem</h3>

On both devices, if the system is idle for long enough to go into standby, it <em>nearly always</em> will give me a screen that states &ldquo;The screen locker is broken and unlocking is not possible anymore&rdquo; and suggests using <code>loginctl unlock-session $SESSION_NUMBER</code> to unlock it.

The <code>~/unlock.sh</code> script I mentioned above is a workaround for this. I'm trying to narrow down the cause, and hopefully fix it.

Here's what I've determined so far:
- If the screen is idle for long enough to lock the screen and then turn off the screen, the screen locker crashes.
- If I lock and unlock the screen quickly, it seems fine.
- If I lock the screen, wait 5 seconds, then unlcok it... it crashes.

Every time, <code>dmesg</code> outputs two lines that look like this:
