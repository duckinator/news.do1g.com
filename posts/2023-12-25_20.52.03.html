Getting Started With KDE Plasma Mobile

I've been playing a lot with KDE Plasma Mobile, and wanted to document my experiences so far.

Here's the setup I'm using, on both a <em>Dell Venue 11 Pro</em> (tablet with attachable keyboard) and a <em>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e</em> (2-in-1 where the keyboard can be flipped around behind the screen):

- Debian 12
- KDE + Plasma Mobile shell
- SDDM (display manager) with virtual keyboard enabled

First, install the base Debian 12 image. (Be sure to install and enable the sshd if you need it!)

Then, run this command:

` apt install plasma-mobile plasma-mobile-tweaks qtvirtualkeyboard-plugin

Then, create a file at <code>/etc/sddm.conf</code> containing the following:

` [General]
` InputMethod=qtvirtualkeyboard

Then, add a user account for yourself by running <code>adduser $YOURUSERNAME</code>.

<h3>The kscreenlocker problem</h3>

On both devices, if the system is idle for long enough to go into standby, then kscreenlocker will <em>nearly always</em> will crash.
When it crashes, it shows a screen stating &ldquo;The screen locker is broken and unlocking is not possible anymore.&rdquo;

Fortunately, it gives you instructions on how to force-unlock it anyway, but it requires a keyboard, so that's pretty annoying on a tablet.

Here's what I've determined so far:
- If the screen is idle for long enough to lock the screen and then turn off the screen, the screen locker <em>always</em> crashes when I try to unlock it.
- If I lock and unlock the screen quickly, it seems fine.
- If I lock the screen, wait 5 seconds, then unlock it... it crashes.

Every time, <code>dmesg</code> outputs two lines that look like this:

` [ 1424.914725] kscreenlocker_g[2396]: segfault at 218 ip 00007fd938b46f9c sp 00007ffc4f1c0e70 error 4 in libQt5Feedback.so.5.0.0[7fd938b46000+4000] likely on CPU 0 (core 0, socket 0)
