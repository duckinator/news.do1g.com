This month I'm focusing on my <a href="https://github.com/duckinator/sgs">open source AAC software</a>.

Part of this is a lot of research &mdash; what words should be quickest to access, where should there be room for customization, etc.

I don't remember where exactly I read about it, but there's this concept of like... a <em>topology</em>(?) of note types.

Some of their ideas didn't mesh well with how my brain works, but after thinking about it a while, I came up with 4 types of notes:

- <em>Ephemeral</em>: log of ideas/observations, possibly related to a specific task/project.
- <em>Prompts</em>: an idea/observation revisit later and expand on.
- <em>Outlines</em>: a structured collection of related thoughts, not yet a cohesive whole.
- <em>Evergreen</em>: More comprehensive in nature, often (but not necessarily) taking the other varieties and refining/consolidating them into a single cohesive but potentially still growing note.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Logbooks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book">waste books</a> are good examples of <em>ephemeral notes</em>.


I've found that, in practice:
- <em>prompts</em> are often interesting things pulled from <em>ephemeral notes</em>.
- <em>outlines</em> are often expansions on <em>prompts</em> and <em>ephemeral notes</em>.
- <em>evergreen notes</em> are when I want to refine something into one cohesive document.


I've streamlined this page to allow me to make good ephemeral notes, and it's allowed me to easily go back and refine them into outlines or the early stages of evergreen notes.

I'm doing quite a lot of research for this AAC software, and I'm hoping I can use this page as a tool to refine my ideas while letting other people see them.
