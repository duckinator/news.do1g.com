I'm gonna spend most of this month focusing on my <a href="https://github.com/duckinator/sgs">open source AAC software</a>.

Part of this is a lot of research &mdash; what words should be quickest to access, where should there be room for customization, etc.

I don't remember where exactly I read about it, but there's this concept of like... a <em>topology</em>(?) of note types.

I didn't fully agree with all of their ideas, but this is a derivative idea based on it:

- <em>Ephemeral notes</em>: either a daily log of Thoughts&trade;, or a running list of ideas and observations related to a specific task/project. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Logbooks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book">waste books</a> fall under this category.
- <em>Prompts</em>: an idea from ephemeral notes to revisit later and expand on.
- <em>Outlines</em>: a structured collection of related thoughts; obviously connected, but yet to be pulled together into a cohesive whole.
- <em>Evergreen notes</em>: More comprehensive in nature, often (but not necessarily) taking the other varieties and refining/consolidating them into a single cohesive but potentially still growing note.

I find that lab notebooks and similar things often wind up containing a mixture of these.


I'm doing quite a lot of research and planning for this AAC software. I'm hoping to treat this page as <em>ephemeral notes</em> for at least this month, and eventually start refining them into more cohesive documents explaining my research.
