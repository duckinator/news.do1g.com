I decided to participate in December Adventure this year.

This is the first time I'd heard of <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">December Adventure</a>, and I like the idea a lot more than the <em>Advent of Code</em> &mdash; it just meshes better with how my brain works.

So, today, I started by setting up a system to make it <em>as easy as possible</em> to document my progress.

I decided to create a static microblog website, inspired by <a href="https://micronews.debian.org/">Debian Micronews</a>.

The way it works is:

- <code>templates/</code> has a collection of templates,
- <code>posts/</code> has a collection of posts,
- <code>build.py</code> combines to create this site and an Atom feed.

Posts are freeform HTML, with no need for using &lt;br&gt; or &lt;p&gt; or anything like that.
You can see <a href="https://github.com/duckinator/news.do1g.com/blob/main/posts/2023-12-06_01.38.17.html">the original source for this post</a> and then view the source of this page to prove it!

Basically, CSS is magic. Specifically <code>white-space: break-spaces;</code>. :3

I then made a bookmarklet which gets the current date and time, then opens GitHub's "new file" page with the filename filled out already.

My problem with blogging is if I have to switch to a different repo, pull out a text editor, etc... it starts feeling like an Endeavour&trade;.

And if it becomes an Endeavour&trade;, I start putting a lot of effort into it &mdash; which promptly backfires, because I don't have the motivation to drive it to completion.

Because I want to <em>work on the thing</em>, not <em>write about the thing</em>.

So I made it as ADHD-friendly as I could, in hopes of mitigating this.


I BANGED OUT THIS POST IN 10 MINUTES.

I just went to Firefox, hit Ctrl-T, clicked a bookmarklet, and started typing. WAY lower friction.
