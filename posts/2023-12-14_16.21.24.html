A quick thought on Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), the original web, and this page.

In practice, this <a href="#2023-12-06-01:38AM">system I've put together</a> feels like it's in the same spirit as the idea of how the first browser, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb (lated renamed Nexus)</a>, approached things: you could edit a page in the browser, save it, and then other people could view it.

It also feels related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal Knowledge Management</a>.

"Time is a circle", "no inventions are truly new", etc, etc.
