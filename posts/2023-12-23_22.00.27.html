Improved Atom feed + site rename

Hi!

I made a few improvements to the site. &hearts;

# The atom feed is actually readable.
# The site now uses a &lt;link rel="alternate" ...&gt; tag to indicate the Atom feed location.
# Posts now get their own pages. Old links still work.
# I moved this site from news.do1g.com to notes.do1g.com &mdash; I recommend updating your bookmarks and such.

Existing posts may still be unreadable if your feed reader cached them.

Shame I didn't think make that change before <a href="https://notes.do1g.com/2023-12-23_02.02.50/">my last post</a>.
