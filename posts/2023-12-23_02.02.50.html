Designing an AAC Vocabulary, part #1 of who knows how many.

Hi! I've not been using this nearly as much as I was hoping, BUT I'm hoping this big ol' pile of words might make up for it!

I want to thank AssistiveWare, the makers of Proloquo (the AAC app I've used for over a year now), for openly writing about how they designed their vocabulary and even citing their sources(!) for their research.

I'm using what they talk about as a starting point, but to be clear: I have no intention of copying their vocabulary choices and organization verbatim. I'm trying to come up with a system from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">first principles</a> &mdash; or as close to that as is reasonable &mdash; for a different target audience.

Before diving in, let's start with a link dump.

AssistiveWare has written about their approach, and these are a starting point for me:

While reading through AssistiveWare's posts (linked above) and thinking about my own experiences with AAC software, I wrote down some key points I want to revisit over the coming weeks.

<h2>Balancing competing needs</h2>

There's no objectively "best" vocabulary/system. You're always balancing competing needs.

Proloquo focuses on language development and providing a system you can grow with.

However, I'm focusing on teens and adults who have developed vocabulary, are somewhat technically proficient, but have difficultiy speaking.

I'm optimizing for a very different group of users, so what I come up with might look wildly different.

In fact, I <em>want</em> it to be different: I'm not trying to make a Proloquo clone, and I'm not trying to make a Proloquo competitor. I'm trying to create an alternative for people who can benefit from AAC but have different needs.

<h2>Motor planning &amp; AAC efficiency</h2>

AAC is inherently slower than speech. This is a fundamental limitation of the concept.

From reading what AssistiveWare has written, as well as my first-hand experience with various AAC apps, there are a few things that make a huge impact on how quickly you can communicate with AAC:

- Make buttons big enough for easy interaction.
- Put common words on the "home" screen, and have a dedicated button to return to that scren.
- Have a small number (<10) of designated categories that are easy to switch between. (Proloquo puts this across the top as tabs; my system currently puts them on the left.)
- Make the most frequently words persistent: Proloquo has 27 other words accessible no matter where you are in the app. 2 of them ("a" and "the") are always immediately available. This is the biggest thing I miss when using other AAC apps.
- Shallow hierarchy: Avoid ever going more than 2 levels deep.
- Grammatical inflections: Show "base" words in the main app, and then show grammatical inflections once you select them -- e.g. "I" is common enough to go on the Home screen, but grammatical inflections like "me", "my", "mine", "myself" will be under grammatical inflections.
- Related words: for "I" this would be things like "I'd", "I'll", "I'm", "I've".

A huge property of an AAC system that affects efficiency is being able know the location of a word ahead of time.

Basically: Unless a word has multiple distinct meanings, only put it in one spot.

If it's used twice and the AAC app uses symbols, give them different symbols. The example AssistiveWare provides is "show": it can be a verb ("can you show me?") or a noun ("they went to a show"). They have two buttons, in different spots, but with different symbols and different meanings.

<h2>Using data for optimization</h2>

AssistiveWare makes a good point in <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/blog/how-is-proloquo-efficient">How did we make Proloquo extremely efficient?</a> when they talk about using hard data to determine how efficient a system is.

This involves things like collecting lists of real-world words and phrases, and determining how many taps per word are needed for each of them.

If I want this project to be usable even though there were half a dozen <em>other</em> open-source AAC systems I gave up on out of frustration, this kind of work is a hard requirement.

<h2>Stable base, with expansions</h2>

A big part of what made Proloquo work better for me than other systems is it has a fixed base, with areas I can add my own words. I think this is a good balance, because it means anyone who uses Proloquo can pick up any other device with Proloquo on it (even without their customizations) and communicate *most* things, even if they might have to type in a few words by hand.

It's certainly a lot better than typing everything by hand, or being utterly lost because there's so little similarity with the system you were using.

<h2>Data collection</h2>

There are MANY things to say about data collection, but I think AssistiveWare's article on <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/blog/aac-data-collection-and-privacy">AAC data collection and privacy</a> explains it well.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

The hardest part of this so far, frankly, has been finding an affordable tablet that can run Linux. If the only devices that can use it cost $400, I might as well just port it to iOS or Android. But if I can get it below $200 and not require a subscription, well, maybe it'll be usable for people less fortunate than I am.

I was given an iPad as a gift explicitly so I could use an AAC app that didn't frustrate me relentlessly. There's been times I went multiple days without speaking, and the ones before I had access to a usable AAC system were far more miserable.
