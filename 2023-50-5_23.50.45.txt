I now have a bookmarklet titled "New Post" that I can click, which takes me to a page where I can write a post!

And, as soon as I commit it, it will be deployed!

I actually like this a lot.

I might actually blog now because this is hella informal and much more friendly to my ADHD than longform stuff?
